                  <p>Players are divided into teams with the aim of collecting all the relics and summoning Cthulhu or eliminating all players on the opposing team/s.</p>
                  <p>The game is played over a series of rounds. Each round consists of two phases that are resolved in the following order:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Player phase</strong>: 
                      <ul>
                        <li>Players take turns to perform actions. (see <em>Player phase, turn and actions</em>)</li>
                        <li>Each team alternates player turns/actions until all players have taken their turn/actions.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Mythos phase</strong>: 
                      <ul>
                        <li>After each player has had their turn, a Mythos phase starts. (see <em>Mythos Phase</em>)</li>
                        <li>All players must resolve the required checks (if they affect them) during this phase.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>After each Mythos phase, the players start a new round beginning with the Player phase. Players continue resolving game rounds until they have won or lost the game.</p>
                  <p>The game ends when either:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>One team has all 4 relics in their possession and successfully summons Cthulhu</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Or have eliminated the players on the opposing team/s</strong>.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Individual players that have gone insane and are not eliminated may also win if they complete their Insane conditions.</p>

                  Setup

                  <p><strong>This custom game mode requires a 6-sided die required for the Move action</strong></p>
                  <h3>Setting up the board</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Configure your own board using <em>Mansions of Madness</em> tiles. (<em>Ideally in 6x4 or 6x5 grid)</em></li>
                    <li>Or use the <em>Mansions of Madness Board generator</em> app to generate a tile configuration for you.</li>
                    <li>Randomly place 12 Search tokens in different spaces on the board.</li>
                    <li>Fix up any doors or walls on the board using the door and wall tokens (if required).</li>
                    <li>Place an Explore token on a random door - this will act as a locked door.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Setup player teams</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>It is recommend to split players into either:
                      <ul>
                        <li>For 4 players: 2 teams of 2</li>
                        <li>For 5 players: 2 teams of 2 (with the spare person acting as a Dungeon Master)</li>
                        <li>For 6 players: 2 teams of 3 or 3 teams of 2</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Players choose an investigator to play as</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Select an investigator (or use your own). For this game mode the follow investigators are recommended:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Carson Sinclair</li>
                        <li>Father Matteo</li>
                        <li>Minh Thi Phan</li>
                        <li>Preston Fairmont - ability works with Search, Steal and Collect, </li>
                        <li>Rita Young</li>
                        <li>Wendy Adams</li>

                        <li class="expSoa"><span class="text-icon soa">&nbsp;</span>Tommy Muldoon</li>
                        <li class="expSot"><span class="text-icon sot">&nbsp;</span>Charlie Kane</li>
                        <li class="expHj"><span class="text-icon hj">&nbsp;</span>Agnes Baker - strong spell attacker</li>
                        <li class="expHj"><span class="text-icon hj">&nbsp;</span>Jim Culver - support/healer</li>
                        <li class="expHj"><span class="text-icon hj">&nbsp;</span>Silas Marsh</li>

                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Be sure to select investigators that may work well together in your team. Remember this is a team game so a good combination would be selecting a good attacker and a good support.</p>
                  <h3>Distribute starting items</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Use the app to generate and distribute items for each team member.</li>
                    <li>If your investigator has an ability that gives them a starting item, collect that item.</li>
                    <li>Players keep and can re-use all items and spells collected unless a condition requires a player to drop an item or spell (relics are retained unless player is eliminated), in which case they drop it in the space they are in. Dropped items can be collected by other players as an action.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Place your investigators on the board</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Each player may place their investigator on the board anywhere around the perimeter (or agreed upon by all players).</li>
                    <li>This is where you'll start the game.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Additional Info</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>When resolving tests:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Players may use Clue tokens to convert <span class="text-icon investigation">&nbsp;</span> to <span class="text-icon success">&nbsp;</span> during any check.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>                 
                    <li>A player is eliminated if they accumulate Damage exceeding their total Damage.  
                      <ul>
                        <li>When they are eliminated, they drop all collected relic items in the space they died in.</li>
                        <li>When a player is eliminated, they come back as a guardian monster. (Refer to Guardian monster and actions below).</li>

Traps affect everyone (except the player placing them on their turn) and may be part of a player's Insane condition. Traps do not affect the player placing them on their turn but take effect after their turn. I.e. if a player places a trap in their turn they are unaffected but will be affected if they move through or are in a space with a hazard, on their next turn.
